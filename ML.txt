Machine learning is the subset of computer science that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.


data engineering is deals with the data analysis.(wed app database server) data ware(structured) and datalink(structured and un)



data science allows to find the pattern from existing data to predict from the future.


LIBRARY: It is the collection of pre written code that developers can use to perform common tasks such as mathematical operations.

****Scikit learn popular open source machine learning in python that provide simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling.

tools:
classification:(decision trees, support vector machine)
regression:(linear regression) 
clustering:(k-means, DBSCAN)
dimensionality reduction:(pca)
model selection and evaluation(cross-validation)*****
